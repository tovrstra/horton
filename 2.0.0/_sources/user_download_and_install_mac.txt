Download and installation on Mac OS X (10.8--10.11)
###################################################

Disclaimer
==========

HORTON has been tested on Mac OS X 10.8--10.11 using MacPorts. If you
are running any other version of OS X or if you are using other package
managers, some of the instructions below may not work.


MacPorts
=========

We strongly recommend that you install all of the packages required by HORTON
through MacPorts. The latest version of MacPorts can be downloaded from the web:
https://www.macports.org/install.php. This guide has been tested using
MacPorts 2.3.3 but should also work with newer versions.

.. note ::

    If you have already installed a Python distribution (with another package
    manager than MacPorts), such as Canopy, it may interfere with the one
    installed through MacPorts. The instructions below assume that no such other
    installation of Python is present.


Quick tour of MacPorts
----------------------

Here are some basic MacPorts commands:

* updating ports (recommended):

  .. code-block:: bash

      sudo port -v selfupdate

* upgrade ports:

  .. code-block:: bash

      sudo port upgrade outdated

* finding ports (e.g, port_name = python27):

  .. code-block:: bash

      sudo port list python27

* searching ports (e.g, port_name = python27):

  .. code-block:: bash

      port search python27

* installing ports (e.g, port_name = python27):

  .. code-block:: bash

      sudo port install python27

* selecting ports (e.g, select python27 as python):

  .. code-block:: bash

      sudo port select --set python python27


Download the code
=================

The latest stable source code release of HORTON can be downloaded here:

    https://github.com/theochem/horton/releases/download/2.0.1/horton-2.0.1.tar.gz

Choose a suitable directory, e.g. ``~/build``, download and unpack the archive:

.. code-block:: bash

    mkdir -p ~/build
    cd ~/build
    curl -kLO https://github.com/theochem/horton/releases/download/2.0.1/horton-2.0.1.tar.gz
    tar -xvzf horton-2.0.1.tar.gz
    cd horton-2.0.1


Dependencies for building, installing and testing HORTON
========================================================

In order to compile and test HORTON, you need to install relatively recent
versions of the following programs/libraries:

* GCC, G++ and GFortran >= 4.9: http://gcc.gnu.org (In principle the Intel compilers or any other combination of C++11 and Fortran compiler should work. The GNU compilers are used for development and testing.)
* Python >= 2.7, < 3.0: http://www.python.org/ (Also install development files.)
* Nosetests >= 1.1.2: http://readthedocs.org/docs/nose/en/latest/
* Atlas >= 3.10.1: http://math-atlas.sourceforge.net/ (Also install development files. You should be able to use any other BLAS implementation as well.)
* NumPy >= 1.9.1: http://www.numpy.org/
* SciPy >= 0.11.0: http://www.scipy.org/
* Cython >= 0.17.1: http://www.cython.org/
* H5Py >= 2.2.1: http://www.h5py.org/
* Sympy >= 0.7.1: http://code.google.com/p/sympy/
* Matplotlib >= 1.0: http://matplotlib.org/
* LibXC == 2.2.2: http://www.tddft.org/programs/octopus/wiki/index.php/Libxc (Also install development files.)

These are installed with the following commands. (When MacPorts is installed in user
space, the ``sudo`` can be omitted.):

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo port install gcc49; sudo port select --set gcc mp-gcc49
    sudo port install python27; sudo port select --set python python27
    sudo port install py27-nose; sudo port select --set nosetests nosetests27

    sudo port install py27-matplotlib
    sudo port install libxc
    sudo port install libint
    sudo port install py27-pip; sudo port select --set pip pip27


.. _mac_manual_dependency_install:

Installing dependencies manually
--------------------------------

**BLAS**

In principle, any BLAS implementation may be used. In case of a custom build,
some environment variables must be set prior to building HORTON, as discussed
in :ref:`mac_compile_install`. Also, Keep in mind that MacPorts only supports Atlas
for building NumPy and SciPy.

**LibXC**

The directory ``tooals/qa`` of the HORTON source tree contains scripts to download and
build LibXC, which will work on most systems:

.. code-block:: bash

    ./tools/qa/install_libxc-2.2.2.sh

This results in a LibXC library suitable for compiling HORTON. If this fails,
consult your local Mac guru to build LibXC. For more info about LibXC, check
the website: http://www.tddft.org/programs/octopus/wiki/index.php/Libxc

**LibInt2**

The directory ``tooals/qa`` of the HORTON source tree contains scripts to download and
build LibInt2, which will work on most systems:

.. code-block:: bash

    ./tools/qa/install_libint-2.0.3.sh

The compilation of LibInt2 takes a few minutes and results in a library suitable for
compiling HORTON. If this fails, consult your local Mac guru to build LibInt2. For more
info about LibInt2, check the website: http://sourceforge.net/p/libint/home


Compilation and installation
============================

Build and install
-----------------

The regular build and install is done as follows:

.. code-block:: bash

    ./setup.py install --user

The ``setup.py`` script makes a reasonable attempt configuring the compiler and
linker settings for the LibXC, LibInt2 and BLAS libraries. However, this does
not work in all environments. In case of a failure, or if a configuration other
than the default is desired, read the following section.


Overriding default compiler/linker settings for LibXC, LibInt2 and BLAS
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

The manual configuration of the compiler and linker settings is described here:
:ref:`setup_cfg`. You should read this section if the default build and install
failed or if you would like to specify which libraries to use.


Runtime configuration
---------------------

You need to set some environment variables to use HORTON. Add the following to
``~/.bash_profile`` if it exists, otherwise add them to ``~/.profile``:

.. code-block:: bash

    export PATH=${HOME}/Library/Python/2.7/bin:${PATH}

If you run HORTON on a headless node, i.e. without an X server, you need to
configure Matplotlib to use a backend that does not require a graphical user
interface. (See http://matplotlib.org/faq/usage_faq.html#what-is-a-backend for
more details on the Matplotlib backends.) This can be done by adding the
following line to your ``matplotlibrc`` file:

.. code-block:: text

    backend: agg

This file is located either in ``${HOME}/.matplotlib`` or
``${HOME}/.config/matplotlib``.


Reference atoms
===============

Several parts of HORTON make use of reference atomic computations. When compiling
a stable release from a .tar.gz file these reference atoms are already included in
the release. When building a development version of HORTON, please refer to
:ref:`ref_build_refatoms` on how to build these reference atoms.


Running the tests
=================

To test that HORTON was installed properly and that you can can access it from
other directories, you should change to a directory outside of the source tree
and call nosetests as follows:

.. code-block:: bash

    (cd ~; nosetests -v horton)


Building the documentation
==========================

Dependencies
------------

If you are interested in generating the documentation from source, the following
packages are also needed:

* Sphinx >= 1.3.1: http://sphinx.pocoo.org/
* Sphinx Read-The-Docs theme >= 0.1.8: https://github.com/snide/sphinx_rtd_theme
* Doxygen >= 1.8.6: http://www.doxygen.org/
* Breathe >= 1.2.0: http://breathe.readthedocs.org/en/latest/
* Docutils >= 0.11: http://docutils.sourceforge.net/


Installing the dependencies with MacPorts and PIP
-------------------------------------------------

Most can be installed directly with MacPorts. The following list of ports is recommended:

* ``doxygen``: https://trac.macports.org/browser/trunk/dports/textproc/doxygen/Portfile

The following commands will install the ports and a few other dependencies (with pip),
which are not available as ports:

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo port install doxygen
    pip install --user --upgrade sphinx sphinx_rtd_theme breathe

You must also manually build LibXC as explained in :ref:`mac_manual_dependency_install`,
to generate the list of DFT functionals in the documentation.


Actual build
------------

The documentation is compiled and viewed as follows:

.. code-block:: bash

    (cd doc; make html; open _build/html/index.html)


.. _mac_install_dev:

Development tools
=================

If you want to contribute to the development of HORTON, you'll need to install at least
the following dependencies:

* PyLint >= 1.5.0: https://www.pylint.org/
* pycodestyle >= 2.0.0: http://pycodestyle.readthedocs.io/
* pydocstyle >= 1.0.0: http://pydocstyle.readthedocs.io/
* coverage >= 4.1: https://coverage.readthedocs.io/
* Cppcheck >= 1.73: http://cppcheck.sourceforge.net/
* Git >= 1.8: https://git-scm.com/
* GitPython >= 2.0.5: http://gitpython.readthedocs.io/

The following list of ports is recommended:

* ``doxygen``: https://trac.macports.org/browser/trunk/dports/textproc/doxygen/Portfile

For the python development tools, we recommend that you install the latest versions with
``pip``.

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo port install cppcheck
    sudo port install git
    pip install --user --upgrade pylint pycodestyle pydocstyle coverage GitPython
